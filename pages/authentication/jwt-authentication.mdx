## JWT Authentication

Most auth providers use this strategy under the hood to provide access tokens. Currently, the app doesn't cover the backend service, and this service is mocked (faked) using http client interceptors. The implementation is basic, but enough to give you a starting point.

### How it was implemented

Since tokens are meant to be created on the backend server, they are built with encrypt, encode and decode utility methods because they are not meant to be used on the client. These utilities can be found in src/fake-db. These are for development purposes only, and you must remove (or avoid using) them.

### How to use JWT Provider

The app is delivered with JWT Provider as default auth strategy. If you changed or removed it and you want it back, simply follow these steps:

### Step 1. Import the auth context provider

Open `src/index.tsx` or `src/app.tsx` file, import the provider and wrap the App component with it.

```tsx
import { FC } from 'react'
import { AuthContextProvider } from './contexts/JWTAuthContext'

const App: FC = () => {
  return (
    <AuthContextProvider>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <RTL direction={theme.direction}>content here</RTL>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </AuthContextProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Step 2. Set the hook context

Open `src/custom-hooks/useAuth.ts` file and replace the current context the following line:

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react'
import { AuthContext } from '../contexts/JWTAuthContext'

const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext)

  if (!context)
    throw new Error('useAuth must be use inside AuthContextProvider')

  return context
}

export default useAuth
```

### How to use useAuth hook

#### Retrieve user profile

In the example below, you can find how it can be used in any component not just the App. Should you want to use it in any other component, you'll have to import the useAuth hook and use it as needed.

```tsx
import useAuth from './custom-hooks/useAuth'

const App = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth()

  return <div>Email: {user.email}</div>
}
```

### Auth methods / actions

```tsx
import useAuth from './custom-hooks/useAuth'

const App = () => {
  const { login } = useAuth()

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => login()}>Login</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
