## Routing

### Implementation

To control the navigation and linking between components the app uses `react-router` and `react-router-dom` libraries.

At first You need to import all_route from `src/routes/routes` folder. then you can use it in your app component

### Routes file

```tsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";
import Loading from "../components/loading/Loading";

const Loadable = (Component: any) => (props: any) =>
  (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <Component {...props} />
    </Suspense>
  );

// Dashboard page
const DashboardLayout = Loadable(
  lazy(() => import("../Layouts/DashboardLayout"))
);

// authentication pages
const Signin = Loadable(lazy(() => import("../pages/sessions/Signin")));
const Signup = Loadable(lazy(() => import("../pages/sessions/Signup")));
const ForgotPassword = Loadable(
  lazy(() => import("../pages/sessions/ForgotPassword"))
);

// routes
export const all_routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <DashboardLayout />,
    children: [
        here will be children components
    ]
  },
  {
    path: "/session/signin",
    element: <Signin />,
  },
  {
    path: "/session/signup",
    element: <Signup />,
  },
  {
    path: "/session/forgot-password",
    element: <ForgotPassword />,
  },
  {
    path: "/session/404",
    element: <NotFound />,
  },
  {
    path: "*",
    element: <NotFound />,
  },
];
```

### Route Integration

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { all_routes } from './routes/routes'
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const app_pages = useRoutes(all_routes)

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>{app_pages}</Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```
